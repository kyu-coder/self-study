1.3 Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures

Procedures are, in effect, abstractions that describe compound operations on numbers independent of the particular numbers.

Ex.
(define (cube x) (* x x x))

we are not talking about the cube of a particular number, but rather about a method for obtaining the cube of any number.

One of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language is the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common patterns and then to work in terms of the abstractions directly.
