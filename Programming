"We recommend working through at least the first three chapters of SICP and doing the exercises."



"SICP is unique in its ability—at least potentially—to alter your fundamental beliefs about computers and programming. 
Not everybody will experience this. Some will hate the book, others won't get past the first few pages. 
But the potential reward makes it worth trying."



If you don't enjoy SICP, try Composing Programs. If that still doesn't suit, try How to Design Programs.

If none of these seem to be rewarding your effort, perhaps that's a sign that you should focus on other topics for some time, 
and revisit the discipline of programming in another year or two.
