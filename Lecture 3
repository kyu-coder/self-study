(lambda (x) (* x x))
returns a procedure


(define (square x) (* x x))

is an abbreviation for

(define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))

this is the same kind of define as

(define foo (+ 2 3))

lambda makes a procedure. lambda is how you make a procedure.
lambda is the only way to make a procedure.

((lambda (x) (* x x)) 6)
returns 36


Programming is easy if you can see the whole program at once
so we try to make our program smaller
one way to do that is by generalizing patterns
